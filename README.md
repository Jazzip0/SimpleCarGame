####SimpleCarGame
Simple Car game is a game where you are a car that drives in the wrong direction of an one-way road. <br /> The traffic will brake for you, but traffic will never slow down completely. You start with 10 lives and lose one for every car (or truck) you hit. Try to stay alive as long as possible by dodging cars or run into ambulances to gain a life back.

The game is can be controlled locally and via websockets. Using this last method it is possible to have multiple players using their phones to controll the game. (This controller can use the build in accelrometer, touch buttons or in the case of a computer the arrow keys)

Available [here](http://joepschyns.me/scg/), and the link for the controller on http://joepschyns.me/controller/.
